March Madness Modeling Project
Welcome to the March Madness Modeling Project! This project involves predictive analytics for NCAA basketball tournaments, aiming to generate and optimize brackets for successful outcomes.

Features
Predictive Analytics: Utilizes historical game statistics to predict tournament outcomes and generate optimized brackets.
Data Handling: Efficiently processes large datasets of NCAA basketball statistics.
Bracket Optimization: Produces brackets that have achieved high accuracy, reaching the up to 99.9th percentile in predictions, and 80th percentile consistently.
Current Status

Visualization: Visualization features are currently in progress. We are working on integrating dynamic visual elements to showcase the predictive model and bracket generation process.
Demo Code: While the full source code is private, demo code showcasing key functionalities and techniques is available in the repository.
